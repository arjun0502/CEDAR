### Basal cell signature in MCF7 cells  

I took basal markers from the normal breast epithelium cells and saw how they mapped onto MCF7 cells. 

#### Expression of basal markers by MCF7 clusters (0-5)

```{r basal signature MCF7 cells, echo = FALSE} 
basal_markers <- FindMarkers(healthy, ident.1 = c(1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11), ident.2 = c(0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10), only.pos = T)

not_in_MCF7 <- c("RAB38", "MRGPRX3", "NNMT", "C2orf40", "PDLIM4", "CALML3", "SPARC", "KRT6B", "G0S2", "MT1E", "MYL9", "KRT14")

basal_in_MCF7 <- setdiff(rownames(basal_markers)[1:50], not_in_MCF7)

cluster.averages <- AverageExpression(MCF7, assays = "RNA", features = basal_in_MCF7, verbose = F)

cluster.averages <- cluster.averages$RNA

average_expression_per_cluster <- colMeans(cluster.averages)

average_expression_per_cluster
```

#### MCF7 plots of basal markers

```{r fp, echo= F}
DoHeatmap(MCF7, features = basal_in_MCF7)

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "TAGLN", min.cutoff = "q9")

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "SFN")

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "ID3")

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "CAV1")

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "CALD1")

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "S100A2")

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "DST")
```

#### Analysis

The basal markers are most expressed in cluster 2 and least expressed in cluster 0 (ER+) and 4.

**************************************************************************
### Luminal cells signature in MCF7 cells  

I took luminal markers from the normal breast epithelium cells and saw how they mapped onto MCF7 cells. 

#### Expression of luminal markers by MCF7 clusters (0-5)

```{r luminal signature MCF7 cells, echo = FALSE } 
luminal_markers <- FindMarkers(healthy, ident.1 = c(0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10), ident.2 = c(1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11), only.pos = T)

not_in_MCF7 <- c("ERO1A", "SCGB2A2", "SERPINB4", "PI3", "RARRES1", "LTF", "CD24")

lumin_in_MCF7 <- setdiff(rownames(luminal_markers)[1:50], not_in_MCF7)

cluster.averages <- AverageExpression(MCF7, assays = "RNA", features = lumin_in_MCF7, verbose = F)

cluster.averages <- cluster.averages$RNA

average_expression_per_cluster
```

#### MCF7 plots of luminal markers

```{r feature_plts, echo=F}
DoHeatmap(MCF7, features = lumin_in_MCF7)

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "KRT19")

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "KRT18")

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "CLDN4")
```

#### Analysis

The luminal markers are generally equally expressed in all clusters, however they are least expressed in cluster 2 (ER-)

### Basal cancer signature in MCF7 cells 

I took pam50 markers for basal-subtype of breast cancer and saw how they mapped onto MCF7 cells. 

#### Expression of basal cancer markers by MCF7 clusters (0-5)

```{r basal-subtype MCF7, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cluster.averages <- AverageExpression(MCF7, assays = "RNA", features = c("UBE2C", "PTTG1", "MYBL2", "BIRC5", "CCNB1", "TYMS", "MELK", "CEP55",  "ANLN", "KIF2C", "EXO1", "CENPF", "CCNE1", "MKI67", "MYC", "FOXC1", "ACTR3B"), verbose = F)

cluster.averages <- cluster.averages$RNA

average_expression_per_cluster <- colMeans(cluster.averages)

average_expression_per_cluster
```

#### MCF7 plots of basal-cancer markers

```{r section, echo=F}
DoHeatmap(MCF7, features = c("UBE2C", "PTTG1", "MYBL2", "BIRC5", "CCNB1", "TYMS", "MELK", "CEP55", "ANLN", "KIF2C", "EXO1", "CENPF", "CCNE1", "MKI67", "MYC","FOXC1", "ACTR3B"))

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "PTTG1", min.cutoff = "q9")
FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "CCNB1", min.cutoff = "q9")
FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "UBE2T", min.cutoff = "q9")
```

#### Analysis 

Basal-cancer markers are most expressed in cluster 0 (ER+) and cluster 5, and they are least expressed in cluster 2 (ER-)

### Luminal cancer signature in MCF7 cells

I took pam50 markers for luminal-subtype of breast cancer and saw how they mapped onto MCF7 cells. 

#### Expression of luminal-cancer markers in MCF7 clusters (0-5)
```{r luminal-subtype MCF7, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
cluster.averages <- AverageExpression(MCF7, assays = "RNA", features =c("TMEM45B", "BAG1", "PGR", "MAPT", "ESR1", "CXXC5", "GPR160", "FOXA1", "BLVRA", "NAT1", "UBE2T"), verbose = F)

cluster.averages <- cluster.averages$RNA

average_expression_per_cluster <- colMeans(cluster.averages)

average_expression_per_cluster
```

#### MCF7 plots of luminal-cancer markers
```{r rand, echo=F}
DoHeatmap(MCF7, features = c("TMEM45B", "BAG1", "PGR", "MAPT", "ESR1", "CXXC5", "GPR160", "FOXA1", "BLVRA", "NAT1", "UBE2T"))

FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "PGR")
FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "ESR1")
FeaturePlot(MCF7, features = "GPR160")
```

#### Analysis 

Luminal-cancer markers are most expressed in ER+ clusters, and they are least expressed in cluster 2 (ER-)
